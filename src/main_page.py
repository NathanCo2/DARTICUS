\section Hardware

The blaster selected for this project was a Nerf Rival Knockout XX - 100 Blaster. This blaster was selected 


This project was developed with utilizing two DC motors that contolled the x-axis of motion. One DC motor
is used for the 180 degree pivot that flips the blaster at the being of the duel using a pulley belt drive system.
The other DC motor was used to aim the blaster. It is important to note that both motors were ran with an Encoder
to ensure that the our aim was precise. The system also utilized a thermal camera, a mlx90640 camera, that allowed
our system to read the heat signatures from the opposing team. The camera task will be futher elaborated on in the
following sections.
