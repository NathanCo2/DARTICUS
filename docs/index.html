<div class="textblock"><p>This project was developed for the ME405 term project that required the development of a autonomous launcher. The goals of this project is to develop a thermal heating seeking dueling nerf gun turrent named D.A.R.T.I.C.U.S. that can target and launch a projectile without user intervention. Our team was able to successfully design a multitasking system that seemlessly integrated controls to operate the designed mechanical system.</p>
<p>D.A.R.T.I.C.U.S stands for: Dueling Autonomous infraRed Tracking IronClad Unrivaled Sentry. This name was selected to intimidate our competition and convey the advanced capabilities of our autonomous launcher. By choosing an acronym that evokes strength, precision, and cutting-edge technology, we aimed to assert out dominance in the lab and showcase the exceptional capabilities of our project. The image below displays D.A.R.T.I.C.U.S in all his glory.</p>

Hardware</h1>
<p>The blaster selected for this project was a Nerf Rival Knockout XX - 100 Blaster. After researching, it was concluded this blaster met our system requirments with its high intensity and compact size. This spring-loaded blaster is manually loaded and utilizing a slide-action mechanism that has a single-fire. To pull the trigger it takes a 10lbf requiring us to carefully select a servo-motor that is capable of firing our system. A MG996R digital servo motor was selected as it operates within the torque range required to pull the trigger, abot 12 kg-cm for 6V.</p>
<p>This project was developed with utilizing two DC motors that contolled the x-axis of motion. One DC motor is used for the 180 degree pivot that flips the blaster at the being of the duel using a pulley belt drive system. This motor is the same that was used in our previous labs. The other DC motor utilized was a Metal Gearmotor 25D MP 12V. This DC motor enabled a more accurate precision that was used to aim the blaster. It is important to note that both motors were ran with an Encoder to ensure optimal movements from our system.</p>
<p>To enable the tracking a thermal camera, a mlx90640 camera, was used that allowed our system to read the heat signatures from the opposing team. The camera task will be futher elaborated on in the following sections. </p><pre class="fragment">Bill of Materials:
